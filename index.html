<h1>Molleindustria: the macdonalds videogame</h1>
<p>The video game the macdonalds videogame by artist group Molleindustria is a simulator
game where the player operates the MacDonalds franchise through management of
purchases and segments of internal operations. The game is endless, the only ending to the
game is if the player’s operations become too costly and the simulated MacDonalds
corporation goes bankrupt, causing the player to be fired. In the game, the player controls
four individual scenes of operations that are interconnected; for example, even if the player
has managed to set up a balanced agricultural sector, having an ineKective advertising
campaign may lower traKic to MacDonald’s restaurants, causing the uncovered operation
costs of the agricultural sector to bankrupt the player. The game’s many systems all promote
the idea of balance, the player must operate the sectors as components of one operation
rather than individual operations. The game is playable in the browser and also
downloadable on Windows OS and Mac OS.</p>
